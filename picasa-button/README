This is the button for Picasa.
You have to put it under Picasa3\buttons. Fullpath is generally under C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Picasa3\buttons
You can open the file with notepad and you must change the '<param  name="exe_path"'  attribute to location that you keep the exe.
After that, just select some GPS tagged photos with GPSless ones and click the button.
